# Calibration Companion

This plugin was created to calibrate your 3D printer settings easily.
It comes really handy when you want to try a new filament for instance.
Let me explain all the tabs a bit more precisely before throwing yourself in the process.

This is the development version containing the next features of the Calibration Companion plugin and is very likely to be unstable. Be extremely careful using it, and only do it if you feel it.
